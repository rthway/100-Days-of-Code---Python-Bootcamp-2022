Q.2 - When you run your program, it should print the following:

Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.'''

print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')

# Q.3 - Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡
name = input("What is your name?")
print(len(name))

#another Method
print(len(input("What is your name?")))

''' Q.4 - Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-4 and 12-18. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.

Example Input
a: 3
b: 5
Example Output
a: 5
b: 3

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)

Q.5
Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
print(int(two_digit_number [0] ) + int(two_digit_number [1]))
